      <description>Climate target numbers are approximate. Their roundness reflects that.</description>

      <description>Every 6&amp;ndash;7 years, major climate modeling centers around the world submit their climate simulations to an organization called the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). CMIP distributes the simulation data so that scientists around the world can analyze and compare the models. But what criteria should we use to judge or rank models? How do you decide whether one model is better than another? Do we care about superficial beauty or inner beauty?</description>

      <description>If the globe warms slightly beyond 2Â°C, will we cross a climate tipping point that leads to runaway warming or catastrophe? Are we doomed if we don&amp;rsquo;t stop the warming by 2030 (or 2050)? Predictions of imminent climate tipping points often capture the imagination of the media and the public. Aren&amp;rsquo;t the harmful consequences of a steadily warming climate and its effect on extreme weather bad enough to spur action? Do we need even more things to worry about?</description>
