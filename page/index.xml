      <description>Metamodel: a model that consists of statements about models.
This is a blog about the language, science, and philosophy of predictive modeling. The aim is to be more whimsical than polemical, and mostly non-technical. The discussions will generally be about climate models, which are arguably the most complex models ever built. But models from related fields will make a guest appearance now and then. The discussions will frequently venture beyond science because prediction of long-term climate change is now so intertwined with the cultural milieu that it is impossible to discuss it within a purely scientific context.</description>
