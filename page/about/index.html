<p>This is a blog about the language, science, and philosophy of predictive modeling. The aim is to be more whimsical than
polemical, and mostly non-technical.  The discussions will generally be about climate models, which are arguably the
most complex models ever built. But models from related fields will make a guest appearance now and then. The
discussions will frequently venture beyond science because prediction of long-term climate change is now so intertwined
with the cultural milieu that it is impossible to discuss it within a purely scientific context.</p>
<p>Every time you, your company, or your government, plan for the future, you are
relying on the output of models, whether or not you are aware of it. But models
are imperfect abstractions of reality. You need to understand models to use them
properly. You don&rsquo;t need to analyze petabytes of data or use supercomputers to
understand models and their predictions. Often, all it takes is critical analysis
and logical reasoning, as this blog will try to demonstrate. As statistician
George Box observed, &ldquo;all models are wrong; but some are useful.&rdquo; It is only by
analyzing how models are wrong can one determine how best to use them.</p>
<p>Climate models are the essential tools used by IPCC to assess our climate
futures and guide mitigation and adaptation. As a climate scientist who has
worked with many different models over decades, I am keenly aware of their
strengths as well as their limitations. This blog will critically examine
climate and other models. The purpose is not to diminish the seriousness of the
threat of climate change, but to increase the efficacy of the urgent actions
needed to mitigate it.</p>

<p>Long-form blogs seem too passé in this age of short-form Twitter and Tiktok. But
long-form articles are still important, because many complex issues cannot be
discussed efficiently using a short format. At the other extreme, one can use the
really long-format of a book to discuss the
<a href="https://ClimateDemon.com">science and philosophy of modeling</a>. But books are
not free, they take time to read, and do not address current developments. Blog
posts are free, relatively quick to read, and can address emerging issues.</p>
<p>There are a few <a href="/page/links/#other-climate-modeling-blogs">climate blogs</a> that are still around, but they are
less active. Perhaps because climate denial has shifted from attacking the
science to attacking the solutions. But models, climate and otherwise, continue
to play an important role in climate solutions. There is perhaps still a role
for a blog that discusses modeling and prediction.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://metamodel.blog">metamodel.blog</a> is the primary home of
this blog. Keeping with current trends, posts will be announced on Twitter and you
may also comment on posts by replying to the &ldquo;official&rdquo; announcement tweet. Due
to algorithmic ranking, you may not see my tweets announcing new posts even if
you follow me on Twitter. Also, not everyone is on Twitter, which in itself is
currently in a state of flux. Therefore, all posts will be mirrored on
<a href="https://substack.metamodel.blog">substack.metamodel.blog</a> to provide a free
subscription option for those who prefer to receive posts via email.</p>

<p><a name="motivation-and-format"></a><strong>Motivation and format</strong></p>
<p>Human nature abhors a prediction vacuum. People always want to know, and often
need to know, what may happen in the future. If a particular source (say,
astronomy) can&rsquo;t provide that information, people will tend to go to a
different source that is willing to provide that information (say,
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/astrology-fans-feel-the-dread-mercury-is-in-retrograde-an-extra-time-this-year-11650292198">astrology</a>). Until
the weather service started issuing seasonal forecasts using computer models,
people relied on folksy predictions from the
<a href="https://www.almanac.com/">Old Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac</a> or
<a href="https://www.groundhog.org/">groundhogs named Phil</a>. Today, predictions from
scientific models are used to make decisions that affect millions of people,
often costing many billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Models, scientific or otherwise, will always be used to make decisions. But
<a href="https://thebulletin.org/roundtable/the-uncertainty-in-climate-modeling/">models are frequently misunderstood</a>
by the general public. All scientists can do is to help ensure that the most
appropriate models are used and that their predictions are interpreted with the
necessary caveats.</p>
<p>The landscape of models is somewhat like the wild west &ndash; there&rsquo;s the good, the
bad, and sometimes even the ugly. It&rsquo;s not easy for an outsider to figure out
which is which because there are no clear rules. The word <em>model</em> itself can
mean very different things in diverse fields such as economics, epidemiology,
physics, and climate science. This often results in outsider misconceptions
about how models in a particular field work.</p>
<p>In climate science, models are not used only for predicting the future, but also
to improve our understanding of phenomena. For example, simple nonlinear models
are used for qualitative understanding of amplifying climate feedbacks, such as
the release of methane from melting permafrost or the increased reflection of
sunlight due to melting icesheets. But such simple models aren&rsquo;t necessarily
good at making quantitative predictions. Misunderstanding the limitations of
models leads to people panicking about tipping points at specific
temperature thresholds or believing in prophecies of imminent doom.</p>
<p>Complex models, which include numerous processes, are used by IPCC and others to
make quantitative predictions of the future. But these complex models do not
necessarily include all the climate feedbacks that can be studied using simpler
models, because we often do not have sufficient data, or powerful enough
computers, to accurately represent these feedbacks. To paraphrase a famous
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1215538-you-go-to-war-with-the-army-you-have-not">quote</a>,
we can only predict with the most comprehensive models we have, not with even
more comprehensive models that we wish to have in the future.</p>
<p>As society has become increasingly reliant on models for climate risk
assessment, there are many important questions need to be addressed, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What phenomena can be usefully predicted by models?</li>
<li>How well can these phenomena be predicted?</li>
<li>How to choose the best model(s) to use?</li>
<li>Do we really need to use the most complex and
expensive models for a particular problem of interest?</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to provide the background information to help answer
these questions. What you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>new posts at roughly 2&ndash;3 week intervals</li>
<li>some posts on fundamental, but unresolved, climate and modeling issues</li>
<li>some posts on recent developments and publications</li>
<li>&ldquo;non-technical&rdquo; discussions, featuring a mix of science and pop philosophy</li>
<li>(guest posts on modeling-related issues are welcome)</li>
</ul>

<p>As a programmer, I like to roll my own solutions and retain creative control (at
the expense of some convenience). This blog is implemented using open-source
software on a small dedicated virtual linux server. It uses a static web site
generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, with the
<a href="https://github.com/apvarun/blist-hugo-theme">Blist</a> theme and Nginx as the web
server. The site is designed to be mobile and social-media friendly, in keeping
with the times.</p>
<p>Comments on blog posts are handled using
<a href="https://remark42.com">Remark42</a>, a privacy-focused open-source commenting
engine. Commenting on the site requires a &ldquo;social login&rdquo; to avoid
spam. Alternatively, you can simply reply to the &ldquo;official&rdquo; tweet announcing the blog post
to comment on it.</p>
<p>Modifications were made to the Blist theme and Remark42 integration to
tweak the appearance and functionality of the blog. All the custom code
modifications are available on <a href="https://github.com/mitotic/metablog">Github</a>,
but not fully documented yet.</p>
<p>The simple markup language
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is used to format all
the content on the local computer. After previewing locally, the content is
pushed to the linux server. Markdown is also supported for comment entry.</p>
<p>Blog posts are mirrored on <a href="https://substack.metamodel.blog">Substack</a> as
newsletters. Simply copying and pasting the Hugo-generated web output to the
Substack editor appears to work fine for posting (except for extra formatting
like superscripts and subscripts). This extra bit of effort allows me to retain
flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in, while still having access to the popular Substack
platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to the miracle of the universal markup converter, <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>,
all the posts on this blog are automatically converted to an eBook using the ePUB format.
You can download and view the eBook offline. A new book is created each time a new
post is added. Individual articles are also downloadable as ePUB or PDF files.</p>
