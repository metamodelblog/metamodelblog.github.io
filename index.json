CMIP distributes the simulation data so that scientists around the world can analyze and compare the models. But what criteria should we use to judge or rank models? How do you decide whether one model is better than another? Do we care about superficial beauty or inner beauty?","date":"2022-05-10T00:00:00Z","description":"Model meritocracy is a good idea, but the devil is in the details","permalink":"https://metamodel.blog/posts/model-meritocracy/","tags":["model democracy","meritocracy","metrics","model tuning","IPCC","CMIP"],"title":"How to judge a model beauty contest?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"If the globe warms slightly beyond 2°C, will we cross a climate tipping point that leads to runaway warming or catastrophe? Are we doomed if we don\u0026rsquo;t stop the warming by 2030 (or 2050)? Predictions of imminent climate tipping points often capture the imagination of the media and the public. Aren\u0026rsquo;t the harmful consequences of a steadily warming climate and its effect on extreme weather bad enough to spur action? Do we need even more things to worry about?","date":"2022-05-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Nonlinearity generates tipping points, but it also make them hard to predict","permalink":"https://metamodel.blog/posts/predict-tipping-points/","tags":["Explainer","threshold","tipping point","1.5 degrees","net-zero"],"title":"Can we predict global climate tipping points?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Metamodel: a model that consists of statements about models.\nThis is a blog about the language, science, and philosophy of predictive modeling. The aim is to be more whimsical than polemical, and mostly non-technical. The discussions will generally be about climate models, which are arguably the most complex models ever built. But models from related fields will make a guest appearance now and then. The discussions will frequently venture beyond science because prediction of long-term climate change is now so intertwined with the cultural milieu that it is impossible to discuss it within a purely scientific context.","date":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","description":"","permalink":"https://metamodel.blog/page/about/","tags":null,"title":"About this blog"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Disclaimer Rights Commenting Privacy  Disclaimer This is a personal blog.
